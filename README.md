# EduThrift : Online Thrift Store for Educational Purpose
Schools require students to purchase textbooks, uniforms, shoes, school bags and a lot more, not only that but students need stationery, electronic goods and other items to make their school life smooth. It may be affordable for a few, but many others struggle to make ends meet. Hence, we created a thrift store where people can buy and sell second-hand educational products and provide open-sourced notes and textbooks for to help those in need.
